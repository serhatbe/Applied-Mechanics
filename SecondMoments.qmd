## Second Moment Calculations

The **second moment**, or **moment of inertia**, measures how an area or mass is distributed about an axis. Below are the key concepts and formulas.

### 1. General Formula

The second moment of area about the (x)-axis or (y)-axis is: $$
I_x = \int_A y^2 \, dA, \quad I_y = \int_A x^2 \, dA
$$

### 2. Polar Moment of Inertia

The polar moment of inertia about the origin is: $$
J = \int_A \left(x^2 + y^2\right) \, dA
$$

### 3. Composite Areas

For a composite area, the total moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of its components: $$
I_{\text{total}} = \sum I_i
$$ For each component: $$
I_i = I_{c,i} + A_i d_i^2
$$

### 4. Parallel Axis Theorem

To find the moment of inertia about an axis parallel to the centroidal axis: $$
I = I_c + A d^2
$$

### 5. Moments of Common Shapes

#### Rectangle

For a rectangle with base (b) and height (h): $$
I_x = \frac{b h^3}{12}, \quad I_y = \frac{b^3 h}{12}
$$

#### Circle

For a circle with radius (r): $$
I_x = I_y = \frac{\pi r^4}{4}, \quad J = \frac{\pi r^4}{2}
$$

#### Triangle

For a triangle with base (b) and height (h): $$
I_x = \frac{b h^3}{36}, \quad I_y = \frac{h b^3}{36}
$$

## Derivation of the Moment of Inertia of a Rectangle About its Centroidal Axis

We calculate the **moment of inertia** of a rectangle about its **centroidal** $x$-axis. The centroidal axis passes horizontally through the centroid of the rectangle, located at $y = h/2$ (mid-height of the rectangle).

## 1. Moment of Inertia Formula

The formula for the moment of inertia is:

$$
I = \int y^2 \, dA
$$

Here:

-   $y$: distance from the axis of rotation (centroidal axis in this case),

-   $dA$: the infinitesimal area element.

## 2. Setup for the Rectangle

-   The rectangle is centered on the centroidal $x$-axis, so the height ranges from $y = -h/2$ to $y = h/2$.

-   The width of the rectangle is $b$.

-   The infinitesimal area element is $dA = b \, dy$.

The integral becomes:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = \int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 \, b \, dy
$$

## 3. Solve the Integral

Factor $b$ (constant width) outside of the integral:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y^2 \, dy
$$

The integral of $y^2$ is:

$$
\int y^2 \, dy = \frac{y^3}{3}
$$

Apply the limits $y = -h/2$ to $y = h/2$:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \left[ \frac{y^3}{3} \right]_{-h/2}^{h/2}
$$

Substitute the limits:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \left( \frac{(h/2)^3}{3} - \frac{(-h/2)^3}{3} \right)
$$

Since $(-h/2)^3 = -(h/2)^3$, the terms simplify:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \left( \frac{(h/2)^3}{3} + \frac{(h/2)^3}{3} \right)
$$

Combine the terms:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \left( \frac{2(h/2)^3}{3} \right)
$$

Simplify $(h/2)^3 = \frac{h^3}{8}$:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{h^3}{8}
$$

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = b \cdot \frac{h^3}{12}
$$

## 4. Final Result

The moment of inertia of a rectangle about its centroidal $x$-axis is:

$$
I_{\text{centroidal}} = \frac{b h^3}{12}
$$

This is the standard formula for the moment of inertia of a rectangle about its centroidal axis.

## Difference Between First Moment and Second Moment

The **first moment** and **second moment** are concepts from mathematics and physics, describing how quantities are distributed around a reference point (such as the mean or origin). Below is a detailed explanation:

## 1. First Moment

-   **Definition**: The first moment measures the mean or center of mass relative to a reference point.
-   **Formula**: $$
    M_1 = \sum (x_i \cdot f_i)
    $$ where $x_i$ is a value, and $f_i$ is its weight.
-   **Physical Interpretation**: In mechanics, it determines the center of mass or centroid of an object.

## 2. Second Moment

-   **Definition**: The second moment measures the spread or dispersion of values around a reference point.

-   **Formula**: $$
    M_2 = \sum (x_i^2 \cdot f_i)
    $$

    where $x_i$ is a value, and $f_i$ is its weight.

-   **Physical Interpretation**: In mechanics, the second moment of area ($I$) is used to describe an object's resistance to bending or torsion (e.g., the moment of inertia).

## Key Differences

| Feature | First Moment | Second Moment |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Reference** | Measures position relative to a point (e.g., centroid). | Measures spread relative to a point. |
| **Physical Meaning** | Indicates center or balance point. | Indicates resistance or spread. |
| **Example (Physics)** | Center of mass. | Moment of inertia. |

In summary, the **first moment** tells you *where things are*, while the **second moment** tells you *how far things are spread*.
