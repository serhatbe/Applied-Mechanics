## Kinematic Equations

Kinematic equations\index{Kinematic equations} describe the motion of objects under constant acceleration. They relate displacement ($x$), initial velocity ($v_0$), final velocity ($v$), acceleration ($a$), and time ($t$).

Final velocity as a function of initial velocity, acceleration, and time: $$
    v = v_0 + at
    $$ {#eq-v}

Displacement as a function of initial velocity, time, and acceleration: $$
    x = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
    $$ {#eq-x}

Displacement as a function of initial velocity, final velocity, and time: $$
    x = \frac{(v_0 + v)}{2} t
    $$ {#eq-cosx1}

Final velocity squared as a function of initial velocity, acceleration, and displacement: $$
    v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a x
    $$ {#eq-v1}

## Linear Motion Definitions

-   $\textbf{Speed} (v)$: The scalar measure of the rate of change of distance. Mathematically, $$
      v = \frac{d}{t}
      $$ where (d) is distance and (t) is time.

-   $\textbf{Velocity} (\vec{v})$: The vector measure of the rate of change of displacement. It is given by: $$
      \vec{v} = \frac{\Delta \vec{x}}{\Delta t}
      $$ where $\Delta \vec{x}$ is the displacement vector and $\Delta t$ is the time interval.

-   $\textbf{Acceleration} (\vec{a})$: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It is defined as: $$
      \vec{a} = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
      $$

## Equations of Motion (Constant Acceleration)

$$
\vec{v} = \vec{u} + \vec{a}t
$$

$$
\vec{s} = \vec{u}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2
$$

$$
\vec{v}^2 = \vec{u}^2 + 2\vec{a} \cdot \vec{s}
$$

where:

-   $\vec{u}$: Initial velocity
-   $\vec{v}$: Final velocity
-   $\vec{s}$: Displacement
-   $\vec{a}$: Acceleration
-   $t$: Time

## Rotational Motion Definitions

-   $\textbf{Angular Displacement} (\theta)$: The angle through which an object rotates, measured in radians.
-   $\textbf{Angular Velocity} (\omega)$: The rate of change of angular displacement. Mathematically: $$
        \omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
        $$
-   $\textbf{Angular Acceleration} (\alpha)$: The rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time: $$
         \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
         $$

## Equations of Rotational Motion (Constant Angular Acceleration)

$$
\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t
$$

$$
\theta = \omega\_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2 
$$ $$
\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha \theta
$$

where:

-   $\omega_0$: Initial angular velocity

-   $\omega$: Final angular velocity

-   $\theta$ Angular displacement

-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration

-   $t$: Time

## Relation Between Linear and Angular Motion

The relationship between linear and angular motion is described by the following equations:

$v = r \omega$ (linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\omega$),

$a = r \alpha$ (linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$),

$s = r \theta$ (linear displacement $s$ and angular displacement $\theta$).

### Variables

-   $v$: Linear velocity, the rate of change of linear displacement $(v = \frac{ds}{dt})$.

-   $a$: Linear acceleration, the rate of change of linear velocity $(a = \frac{dv}{dt})$.

-   $s$: Linear displacement, the distance moved along the circular path.

-   $r$: Radius of the circular path.

-   $\omega$: Angular velocity, the rate of change of angular displacement $(\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt})$.

-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration, the rate of change of angular velocity $(\alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt})$.

-   $\theta$: Angular displacement, the angle swept by the radius in radians.

## Key Points

-   Linear motion is directly proportional to angular motion, with the radius ((r)) acting as the proportionality constant.

-   These equations apply to uniform circular motion as well as accelerated circular motion.

-   Units for the variables:

    -   $v$: meters per second $(m/s)$,

    -   $a$: meters per second squared $(m/s^2)$,

    -   $s$: meters $(m)$,

    -   $r$: meters $(m)$,

    -   $\omega$: radians per second $(rad/s)$,

    -   $\alpha$: radians per second squared $(rad/s^2)$,

    -   $\theta$: radians ($rad$).
