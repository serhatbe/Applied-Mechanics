## Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams

### **1. Analyze the Problem**

-   **Identify the beam type:** Determine whether it's simply supported, cantilevered, or continuous.

-   **List all loads and supports:** Include point loads, distributed loads, moments, and reactions.

### **2. Calculate Support Reactions**

1.  **Free-Body Diagram (FBD):** Draw the beam with all external forces, moments, and reactions.

2.  **Equilibrium Equations:** Use these to solve for the reactions at the supports:

-   ∑Fy​=0 (Vertical force equilibrium)

-   ∑M=0\sum M = 0∑M=0 (Moment equilibrium about any point)

### **3. Break the Beam into Segments**

Divide the beam into sections based on the locations of loads, supports, and discontinuities. Label each segment.

### **4. Write Equations for Shear Force and Bending Moment**

-   **Shear Force (**V(x)V(x)V(x)): The algebraic sum of vertical forces to the left or right of the section.

-   **Bending Moment (**M(x)M(x)M(x)): The algebraic sum of moments about the section.

### **5. Plot the Shear Force Diagram (SFD)**

1.  **Start at zero at the ends of the beam** (for simply supported beams or free ends).

2.  **Add or subtract forces at load points:**

    -   A point load changes the shear force instantaneously by its magnitude.

    -   A distributed load causes a slope in the SFD.

3.  **Mark zero-crossings:** Identify points where the shear force changes sign, indicating a potential maximum or minimum bending moment.

### **6. Plot the Bending Moment Diagram (BMD)**

1.  **Start with the calculated moments at the supports or free ends.**

2.  **Integrate the shear force:** The area under the SFD gives the bending moment.

3.  **Apply boundary conditions:**

    -   Fixed ends: Zero slope (moment is maximum/minimum).

    -   Simply supported ends: Zero moment.

    -   Free ends: Zero shear force and moment.

### **7. Verify the Results**

-   **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure the diagrams match the physical behavior of the beam.

-   **Continuity:** Check for smooth transitions between segments (except at points of applied moments).

## Summary

| **Load Type** | **Shear Diagram Shape** | **Moment Diagram Shape** |
|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Point Load | Rectangular (constant) | Triangular |
| Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) | Triangular | Parabolas (second degree) |
| Wedge-shaped nonuniform distributed | Parabolas (second degree) | Parabolas (third degree) |
| Moment Load | Step change | Linear |
