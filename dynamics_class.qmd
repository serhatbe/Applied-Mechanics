## Newton's Laws of Motion

1.  **First Law (Law of Inertia)**:\
    An object remains at rest, or in uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by a net external force.\
    $$
    \Sigma F = 0 \implies v = \text{constant}
    $$

2.  **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**:\
    The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.\
    $$
    \vec{F} = m \vec{a}
    $$

3.  **Third Law (Action-Reaction Law)**:\
    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\
    $$
    \vec{F}_{\text{action}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{reaction}}
    $$

## Linear Momentum

Linear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object has. It is defined as the product of an object's **mass** and its **velocity**. Linear momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.

Mathematically, linear momentum is given by:

$$
Linear\ momentum = m \vec{v}
$$

Where:

-   Linear momentum is in kgÂ·m/s.

-   $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms.

-   $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the object in meters per second.

## Angular Momentum

![Angular momentum](images/angularmomentum.png){width="4cm"}

Given **linear velocity** $\vec{v}$ and **angular velocity** $\omega$:

$$
\vec{v} = r \omega
$$

The **linear momentum** is determined by:

$$
\text{Linear momentum} = m \vec{v}
$$

Substituting for $\vec{v}$:

$$
\text{Linear momentum} = m r \omega
$$

The **moment of linear momentum** can then be written as:

$$
\text{Moment of linear momentum} = m r \omega r
$$

The moment of linear momentum is referred to as the **angular momentum**. Simplifying the above equation:

$$
\text{Angular momentum} = m r^2 \omega
$$

Here, $m r^2$ is the **moment of inertia** (second moment of mass) of the object about its axis of rotation, denoted as $I$. Thus, the angular momentum can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Angular momentum} = I \omega
$$

Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.
-   $\omega$ is the angular velocity in $rad/s$.

Additionally, the moment of inertia $I$ is given by:

$$
I = m k^2
$$

Where:

-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.
-   $m$ is the mass in $kg$.
-   $k$ is the radius of gyration in $m$.

## Turning Moment

![Turning moment](images/turningmoment.png){width="4cm" height="3.3cm"}

We know the relation between linear acceleration $a$ and angular acceleration $\alpha$:

$$
a = r \alpha
$$

And

$$
F = ma
$$

Therefore,

$$
F = m \alpha r
$$

If the force is not applied directly on the rim but at a greater or lesser leverage, say $L$ from the center, the effective force on the rim causing it to accelerate will be greater or lesser accordingly, in the ratio of $L$ to $r$. Thus:

$$
F \frac{L}{r} = m \alpha r
$$

Multiplying both sides by $r$,

$$
FL = m \alpha r^2
$$

Now, $FL$ is the torque applied. Therefore, the accelerating torque is:

$$
\tau = m r^2 \alpha
$$

Or,

$$
\tau = m k^2 \alpha
$$

$\tau$ is also given by:

$$
\tau = I \alpha
$$

Where:

-   $\tau$ is the torque in $Nm$.
-   $I$ is the moment of inertia in $m^4$.
-   $\alpha$: Angular acceleration in $rad/s^2$.

## Power by Torque

![A rotating mechanism.](images/powerbytorque.png){width="4cm"}

Consider a force $F$ applied at a radius $r$ on a rotating mechanism, as shown above.

The work done in one revolution is the product of the force and the circumference. Therefore:

$$
W = F \cdot 2 \pi r
$$

If the mechanism is running at $n$ revolutions per second:

$$
\text{Power} = F \cdot 2 \pi r n
$$

Since torque $\tau = F r$, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
P = \tau \cdot 2 \pi n
$$

Given that $\omega = 2 \pi n$:

$$
P = \tau \cdot \omega
$$

Where:

-   $P$ is the power in watts (W),
-   $\tau$ is the torque in newton-meters (Nm), and
-   $\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second (rad/s).

## Kinetic Energy of Rotation

We know that $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of the body. For a rotating body, the effective linear velocity is at the radius of gyration, as this is the radius at which the entire mass of the rotating body can be considered to act.

Let $k$ = radius of gyration (in meters),\
Let $\omega$ = angular velocity (in radians per second).

The relationship between linear and angular velocity is:

$$
v = \omega k
$$

Substituting $v^2 = \omega^2 k^2$ into $K.E. = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ gives:

$$
\text{Rotational K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} m k^2 \omega^2
$$

Since $I = m k^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia:

$$
\text{Rotational K.E.} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
$$
