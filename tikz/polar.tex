\section*{Polar Coordinates}

In a two-dimensional polar coordinate system, a point is represented as \((r, \theta)\), where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(r\) is the radial distance from the origin.
    \item \(\theta\) is the angle between the positive \(x\)-axis and the line joining the origin to the point (measured in radians or degrees).
\end{itemize}

The relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates are:
\[
x = r\cos\theta, \quad y = r\sin\theta
\]

Conversely, given Cartesian coordinates \((x, y)\), the polar coordinates can be obtained as:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]
