\section*{Cartesian Coordinates}

In a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, a point is represented as \((x, y)\), where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(x\) is the horizontal distance from the origin (the \(x\)-coordinate).
    \item \(y\) is the vertical distance from the origin (the \(y\)-coordinate).
\end{itemize}

The distance \(r\) of a point \((x, y)\) from the origin can be calculated using:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) between the positive \(x\)-axis and the line joining the origin to the point can be found as:
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]
