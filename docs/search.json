Established to provide a consistent framework for scientific and technical measurements, SI units facilitate clear communication and data comparison across various fields and countries. The system is based on seven fundamental units: the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for substance, and the candela for luminous intensity.\n2  Scalar and Vector Quantities: In mathematics and physics, a scalar is a quantity with only magnitude (size), whereas a vector has both magnitude and direction. Examples of scalar quantities include numbers, mass, speed, temperature, volume, and time. In contrast, examples of vector quantities include velocity, acceleration, and forces like weight and friction.\n3  Kinematics: Kinematic equations describe the motion of objects under constant acceleration. They relate displacement (\\(x\\)), initial velocity (\\(v_0\\)), final velocity (\\(v\\)), acceleration (\\(a\\)), and time (\\(t\\)).\n4  Dynamics: Linear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object has. It is defined as the product of an object’s mass and its velocity. Linear momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\n5  Moment of a Force: A moment is a mathematical concept that represents the product of a distance and a physical quantity, such as force. Moments are typically defined relative to a fixed reference point and pertain to physical quantities situated at some distance from this point. For instance, the moment of force, commonly referred to as torque, is the product of the force applied to an object and the distance from the reference point to the object.\n6  Stress and Strain: Linear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object has. It is defined as the product of an object’s mass and its velocity. Linear momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\n7  Shear Force and Bending Moment Diagrams: Linear momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object has.

    "text": "1.4 Unity Fraction\nThe unity fraction method, or unit conversion using unity fractions, is a systematic way to convert one unit of measurement into another. This method relies on multiplying by fractions that are equal to one, where the numerator and the denominator represent the same quantity in different units. Since any number multiplied by one remains the same, unity fractions allow for seamless conversion without changing the value.\nThe principle of unity fractions is based on:\n\nSetting up equal values: Write a fraction where the numerator and denominator are equivalent values in different units, so the fraction equals one. For example, \\(\\frac{1km}{1000m}\\) is a unity fraction because 1 km equals 1000 m.\nMultiplying by unity fractions: Multiply the initial quantity by the unity fraction(s) so that the undesired units cancel out, leaving only the desired units.",

We use \\((\\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}}), since\\:1 \\, \\text{km} = 1000 \\, \\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[5 \\, \\text{km} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThe kilometers \\(\\text{km}\\) cancel out, leaving us with meters \\(\\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[\n5 \\, \\text{km} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\nThis step-by-step approach illustrates how the unity fraction cancels the undesired units and achieves the correct result in meters.\nUnity fractions can be extended by using multiple conversion steps. For example, converting hours to seconds would require two unity fractions: one to convert hours to minutes and another to convert minutes to seconds. This approach ensures accuracy and is widely used in science, engineering, and other fields that require precise unit conversions.\n\n\nExample 1.2 Convert \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) to \\(\\text{km/h}\\).\n\nStart with \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\nTo convert meters to kilometers, multiply by \\(\\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}}\\).\nTo convert seconds to hours, multiply by \\(\\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}}\\).\n\n\\[\n15 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}} \\times \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}} = 54 \\, \\text{km/h}\n\\]\nThe meters and seconds cancel out, leaving kilometers per hour: \\(54 \\, \\text{km/h}\\).",

This vector should have its tail (starting point) at the origin or any chosen starting point. Make sure you draw it with the correct direction and length to scale.\nPlace the Second Vector: Take the second vector and place its tail at the “head” (or “tip”) of the first vector. The direction and length should be accurately represented here as well.\nContinue with Additional Vectors: If there are more vectors to add, repeat the process by placing each vector’s tail at the head of the previous one.\nDraw the Resultant Vector: The resultant vector, or the sum of all the vectors, is the vector that goes directly from the “tail” of the first vector to the “head” of the last vector in the chain.

The notation was developed by British mathematician Robert Bow in the 19th century and continues to be a practical tool for visualizing and solving force equilibrium problems in structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Bow’s Notation Space Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Bow’s Notation Vector Diagram\n\n\n\n\n2.12.1 Key Concepts of Bow’s Notation\n\nLabeling Spaces Between Forces:\n\nEach space between external forces (such as loads and reactions) and each internal member of a truss is designated with a unique letter (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).\nThese labels are assigned sequentially around the structure in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.\n\nForce Polygon:\n\nEach labeled space corresponds to a point on a force polygon, which is a closed polygon representing the equilibrium of forces.\nThe lengths and directions of the sides of the force polygon reflect the magnitudes and directions of the forces in each member.\n\nMember Notation:\n\nEach truss member is identified by the two letters representing the spaces it separates. For instance, a member between spaces A and B is labeled as AB.\n\nUtilizing Bow’s Notation in Analysis:\n\nAfter labeling the spaces, equilibrium equations and graphical methods (such as constructing a force polygon) can be employed to determine the magnitude and direction of each force in the truss.\nThe notation simplifies calculations by visually connecting the forces and facilitating the identification of how different forces interact within the structure.\n\n\n\n\n2.12.2 Example of Bow’s Notation Application\nIn a simple triangular truss, the spaces surrounding the triangle may be labeled A, B, and C. If the members connect these spaces, they would be named as AB, BC, and CA. By employing Bow’s Notation, engineers can construct a force polygon, analyze it for equilibrium, and determine the unknown forces in each member of the truss.",

    "text": "2.13 Slings\nA sling is a device or assembly of ropes, cables, or straps used to support and lift loads. Slings play a crucial role in rigging operations, allowing objects to be lifted, lowered, or moved safely and efficiently. Slings are arranged to distribute the load evenly across their length, reducing stress points and ensuring stability. In multi-leg slings (e.g., two-leg or four-leg), the load is shared among the sling legs, which helps stabilize and balance the load.\n\nExample 2.2 A 200 kg mass is suspended as shown in Figure 2.9. Rope A is attached to a beam in two places and is passed through a ring that rest naturally at the centre of rope A. Rope B is attached to the bottom of the ring, and to the 200 kg mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: A 200 kg suspended mass.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the tension in rope B?\nDraw a free body diagram of the forces exerted on the ring.\nWhat is the tension in rope A?\n\nGiven Information\n\nMass \\(m = 200 \\, \\text{kg}\\)\nGravitational acceleration \\(g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)\nAngle \\(\\theta = 25^\\circ\\)\n\n\nTension in Rope B\n\nThe tension \\(T_B\\) in Rope B must support the entire weight of the mass. Therefore,\n\\[\nT_B = m \\cdot g = 200 \\times 9.81 = 1962 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nSo, the tension in Rope B is 1962 N.\n\nFree Body Diagram of the Ring\n\nThe ring is in equilibrium, meaning the net force acting on it is zero. Here’s a breakdown of the forces:\n\nTension \\(T_B\\): Acts downward, equal to the weight of the 200 kg mass.\nTensions \\(T_{A1}\\) and \\(T_{A2}\\): These are the tensions in each side of Rope A. Since the ring is at the center and the setup is symmetrical, \\(T_{A1} = T_{A2} = T_A\\).\n\nSince the ring is in equilibrium, the vertical components of \\(T_{A1}\\) and \\(T_{A2}\\) must balance the downward force from \\(T_B\\).\n\nTension in Rope A\n\nSince the angle between each side of Rope A and the horizontal is \\(\\theta = 25^\\circ\\), we can use trigonometry to find \\(T_A\\).\nThe equilibrium condition is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot T_A \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) = T_B\n\\]\nSolving for \\(T_A\\):\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{T_B}{2 \\sin(\\theta)}\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{1962}{2 \\cdot \\sin(25^\\circ)}\n\\]\nCalculating:\n\\[\nT_A \\approx 2321.24 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nSo, the tension in Rope A is approximately 2321.24 N.",

    "text": "5.4 Centroids using Composite Parts\nIn this section we will discuss how to find centroids of two-dimensional shapes by first dividing them into pieces with known properties, and then combining the pieces to find the centroid of the original shape. This method will work when the geometric properties of all the sub-shapes are known or can be easily determined. The equations we will use for this approach are\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{ \\sum {\\bar{x}_i}\\ A_i}{\\sum A_i} \\qquad \\bar{y} = \\frac{ \\sum {\\bar{y}_i}\\ A_i}{\\sum A_i}\n\\]\nConsider the complex shape below.\n\nThere are often several ways to divide a shape, but it’s best to use as few parts as possible to minimize your computations and opportunities for error. For example, you could choose to break this shape into either a rectangle, a right triangle, and an circular hole:\n\nOnce the complex shape has been divided into parts, the next step is to determine the area and centroidal coordinates for each part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart\n\\(A_i\\)\n\\(\\bar{x}_i\\)\n\\(\\bar{y}_i\\)\n\\(A_i \\bar{x}_i\\)\n\\(A_i \\bar{y}_i\\)\n\n\n\n\n1\n20\n2.5\n2\n50\n40\n\n\n2\n12\n7\n4/3\n84\n16\n\n\n3\n-7.0685\n3\n2\n-21.2057\n-14.1371\n\n\n\\(\\Sigma\\)\n24.9315\n—\n—\n112.7943\n41.8629\n\n\n\nThe last two columns of the table contain the first moments of area \\(Q_x = A_i \\bar{y}_i\\) and \\(Q_y = A_i \\bar{x}_i\\text{,}\\), and are easily filled in by multiplying the values in columns two to four. Be sure to attend to positive and negative signs when multiplying. Note that the moment of area with respect to the \\(x\\) axis uses the distance from the \\(x\\) axis, which is \\(\\bar{y}_i\\text{,}\\), and vice-versa.\n\\[\n\\bar{x}  = \\frac{Q_y}{A}  = \\frac{112.8}{24.93}  = {4.52}\\ cm\n\\] \\[\n\\bar{y}  = \\frac{Q_x}{A}  = \\frac{41.86}{24.93}  = {1.692}\\ cm\n\\]\nFinally, plot the centroid \\((\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\\) on the diagram. If you have made a calculation error it will usually be obvious, because the centroid location won’t “feel right.”",

It is determined during a tensile test.\n\n6.5.1 Formula:\n\\[\n\\text{UTS} = \\frac{F_{\\text{max}}}{A_0}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(F_{\\text{max}}\\) is the maximum applied force (N),\n\\(A_0\\) is the original cross-sectional area (m\\(^2\\)).\n\n\n\n6.5.2 Key Points:\n\nUnits: Measured in Pascals (Pa), commonly in MPa or GPa.\nDuctile Materials: Undergo significant plastic deformation after UTS.\nBrittle Materials: Break shortly after reaching UTS.\n\nBelow is a typical stress-strain curve showing the UTS point:\n\n\n\nStress–strain curve typical of a low-carbon steel\n\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Linear elastic region\nThe first stage is the linear elastic region. The stress is proportional to the strain, that is, obeys the general Hooke’s law, and the slope is Young’s modulus. In this region, the material undergoes only elastic deformation. The end of the stage is the initiation point of plastic deformation. The stress component of this point is defined as yield strength (or upper yield point, UYP for short).\n\n\n6.5.4 Strain hardening region\nThe second stage is the strain hardening region. This region starts as the stress goes beyond the yielding point, reaching a maximum at the ultimate strength point, which is the maximal stress that can be sustained and is called the ultimate tensile strength (UTS). In this region, the stress mainly increases as the material elongates, except that for some materials such as steel, there is a nearly flat region at the beginning.\n\n\n6.5.5 Necking region\nThe third stage is the necking region. Beyond tensile strength, a necking forms where the local cross-sectional area becomes significantly smaller than the average. The necking deformation is heterogeneous and will reinforce itself as the stress concentrates more at small section. Such positive feedback leads to quick development of necking and leads to fracture.",
