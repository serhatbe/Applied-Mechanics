    "text": "1.3 Unity Fraction\nThe unity fraction method, or unit conversion using unity fractions, is a systematic way to convert one unit of measurement into another. This method relies on multiplying by fractions that are equal to one, where the numerator and the denominator represent the same quantity in different units. Since any number multiplied by one remains the same, unity fractions allow for seamless conversion without changing the value.\nThe principle of unity fractions is based on:\n\nSetting up equal values: Write a fraction where the numerator and denominator are equivalent values in different units, so the fraction equals one. For example, \\(\\frac{1km}{1000m}\\) is a unity fraction because 1 km equals 1000 m.\nMultiplying by unity fractions: Multiply the initial quantity by the unity fraction(s) so that the undesired units cancel out, leaving only the desired units.",

We use \\((\\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}}), since\\:1 \\, \\text{km} = 1000 \\, \\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[5 \\, \\text{km} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\text{m}}{1 \\, \\text{km}} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\\]\n\nThe kilometers \\(\\text{km}\\) cancel out, leaving us with meters \\(\\text{m}\\):\n\n\\[\n5 \\, \\text{km} = 5000 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\nThis step-by-step approach illustrates how the unity fraction cancels the undesired units and achieves the correct result in meters.\nUnity fractions can be extended by using multiple conversion steps. For example, converting hours to seconds would require two unity fractions: one to convert hours to minutes and another to convert minutes to seconds. This approach ensures accuracy and is widely used in science, engineering, and other fields that require precise unit conversions.\n\n\nExample 1.2 Convert \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\) to \\(\\text{km/h}\\).\n\nStart with \\(15 \\, \\text{m/s}\\).\nTo convert meters to kilometers, multiply by \\(\\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}}\\).\nTo convert seconds to hours, multiply by \\(\\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}}\\).\n\n\\[\n15 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{km}}{1000 \\, \\text{m}} \\times \\frac{3600 \\, \\text{s}}{1 \\, \\text{h}} = 54 \\, \\text{km/h}\n\\]\nThe meters and seconds cancel out, leaving kilometers per hour: \\(54 \\, \\text{km/h}\\).",

    "text": "2.2 Concepts\nIn mathematics and physics, a scalar is a quantity with only magnitude (size), whereas a vector has both magnitude and direction. Examples of scalar quantities include numbers, mass, speed, temperature, volume, and time. In contrast, examples of vector quantities include velocity, acceleration, and forces like weight and friction.\nA vector is represented as an arrow, where the length denotes its magnitude, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Vector diagrams are useful for visually conveying information about vector relationships, allowing us to analyze effects like the combination of forces or the movement of objects in two or three dimensions. In such diagrams, vectors are often drawn to scale and placed with respect to an origin or another reference point.\n\n2.2.1 Coplanar Forces\nCoplanar forces are forces that act within the same plane. This means they lie along a single, flat surface, and their lines of action do not extend out of that plane. Coplanar forces are often analyzed together in physics and engineering because their combined effects can be resolved within two dimensions.\n\n\n2.2.2 Space Diagrams\nThe space diagram is an illustration of the system of forces.\n\n\n2.2.3 Vector Diagrams\nThe vector diagram is a diagram drawn to scale with the vectors joined end to end. Vector diagrams are used to analyze and combine forces to find the resultant.\n\n\n2.2.4 Resultant\nThe resultant is a single force that represents the combined effect of two or more forces acting on an object. It has the same effect as applying all the original forces together and is found by adding the individual forces, taking both their magnitudes and directions into account. The resultant gives the overall direction and magnitude of the combined forces.\n\n\n2.2.5 Equilibrium\nEquilibrium of an object occurs when all the forces acting on it are balanced, so the object remains at rest or moves at a constant speed in a straight line. In equilibrium, there is no net force or acceleration, meaning the object is in a stable state without any change in its motion.\nCondition of equilibrium:\n\nNet force must be zero: \\(\\sum F = 0\\)\nNet torque must be zero: \\(\\sum T = 0\\)\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Bow’s Notation\nBow’s Notation is a way to label forces in a system by marking spaces in the diagram with capital letters (A, B, C, etc.). Each force is named after the two spaces it separates, like force AB or force BC. In the vector diagram, each force’s vector is labeled at both ends with matching lowercase letters (e.g., ah, bc) in the direction of the arrow.\n\n\n2.2.7 Slings\nA sling is a device or assembly of ropes, cables, or straps used to support and lift loads. Slings play a crucial role in rigging operations, allowing objects to be lifted, lowered, or moved safely and efficiently. Slings are arranged to distribute the load evenly across their length, reducing stress points and ensuring stability. In multi-leg slings (e.g., two-leg or four-leg), the load is shared among the sling legs, which helps stabilize and balance the load.\n\n\n2.2.8 Jib Cranes\nA simple jib crane has a vertical post, a jib, and a tie. The jib is hinged at its lower end to the post, and the tie connects the top of the jib to the base of the post, forming the crane head where the tie and jib meet.\nWhen a load is hung directly from the crane head, solving for forces involves a simple triangle of forces. In other cases, the crane may have a pulley at the head, with a rope running over it to a winch, creating a system with more than three forces.",

    "text": "2.3 Classwork\n\nExample 2.1 A vertical lifting force of 95 N is applied to a body, and simultaneously, a horizontal force of 135 N pulls on it. Determine the magnitude and direction of the resulting force.\nTo solve for the magnitude and direction of the resultant force, we can use vector addition.\nGiven:\n\nVertical force, \\(F_v = 95 \\, \\text{N}\\)\nHorizontal force, \\(F_h = 135 \\, \\text{N}\\)\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Magnitude of the Resultant Force\nThe resultant force \\(F_r\\) is the vector sum of the vertical and horizontal forces. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nF_r = \\sqrt{F_v^2 + F_h^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nF_r = \\sqrt{95^2 + 135^2}\n\\]\nCalculating further:\n\\[\nF_r = \\sqrt{9025 + 18225} = \\sqrt{27250}\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nF_r \\approx 165.07 , \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 2: Determine the Direction of the Resultant Force\nThe direction \\(\\theta\\) of the resultant force with respect to the horizontal can be found using the tangent function:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{F_v}{F_h} \\right)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{95}{135} \\right)\n\\]\nCalculating \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx 35.07^\\circ\n\\]\nFinal Answer\nThe magnitude of the resultant force is approximately \\(165.07  \\text{N}\\), and its direction is \\(35.07^\\circ\\) above the horizontal.\n\n\nExample 2.2 Two forces act upon a body. One exerts a horizontal force to the right with a magnitude of 25 Newtons, while the other exerts a vertical force downward with a magnitude of 20 Newtons. Determine the magnitude and direction of a third force that would counteract the combined effects of the other two forces.\nTo determine the magnitude and direction of the third force that counteracts the combined effects of the two forces, we first need to find the resultant force of the two given forces.\nGiven Forces:\n\nHorizontal force to the right: \\(F_h = 25 \\, \\text{N}\\)\nVertical force downward: \\(F_v = 20 \\, \\text{N}\\)\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Resultant Force\nThe resultant force \\(F_r\\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem since the forces are perpendicular to each other.\n\\[\nF_r = \\sqrt{F_h^2 + F_v^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\nF_r = \\sqrt{25^2 + 20^2}\n\\]\nCalculating:\n\\[\nF_r = \\sqrt{625 + 400} = \\sqrt{1025}\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nF_r \\approx 32.02 , \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 2: Determine the Direction of the Resultant Force\nThe direction \\(\\theta\\) of the resultant force can be found using the tangent function:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{F_v}{F_h} \\right)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{20}{25} \\right)\n\\]\nCalculating \\(\\theta\\):\n\\[\n\\theta \\approx 38.66^\\circ\n\\]\nThis angle is measured from the horizontal axis (to the right) downward.\nStep 3: Determine the Third Force\nTo counteract the resultant force, the third force \\(F_3\\) must have the same magnitude as \\(F_r\\) but in the opposite direction. Therefore, its magnitude is:\n\\[\nF_3 = F_r \\approx 32.02 , \\text{N}\n\\]\nThe direction of the third force will be opposite to the direction of the resultant force, which means it will be directed at an angle of:\n\\[\n\\theta + 180^\\circ \\approx 38.66^\\circ + 180^\\circ \\approx 218.66^\\circ\n\\]\nFinal Answer\nThe magnitude of the third force is approximately \\(32.02  \\text{N}\\) , and its direction is approximately \\(218.66^\\circ\\) (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis or horizontal right).\n\n\nExample 2.3 Determine the magnitude and direction of the equilibrium force resulting from the combination of two forces: a horizontal pull of 15 N and a pull of 25 N at an angle of 55 degrees with respect to the 15 N force.\nTo find the magnitude and direction of the equilibrium force resulting from the combination of two forces (15 N horizontally and 25 N at an angle of 55 degrees), we can use vector addition.\nStep 1: Resolve the Forces into Components\n\nForce \\(F_1 = 15\\text{N}\\) (Horizontal):\n\n\\(F_{1x} = 15 \\, \\text{N}\\)\n\\(F_{1y} = 0 \\, \\text{N}\\)\n\nForce \\(F_2 = 25 \\text{N}\\) at \\(55^\\circ\\):\n\n\\(F_{2x} = F_2 \\cdot \\cos(55^\\circ) = 25 \\cdot \\cos(55^\\circ)\\)\n\\(F_{2y} = F_2 \\cdot \\sin(55^\\circ) = 25 \\cdot \\sin(55^\\circ)\\)\nStep 2: Calculate Components of \\(F_2\\)\nUsing \\(\\cos(55^\\circ) \\approx 0.5736\\) and \\(\\sin(55^\\circ) \\approx 0.8192\\):\n\\[\nF_{2x} = 25 \\cdot 0.5736 \\approx 14.34 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\\[\nF_{2y} = 25 \\cdot 0.8192 \\approx 20.48 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 3: Find the Resultant Components\nNow, we sum the components in the x and y directions:\n\nResultant x-component:\n\n\\[\nR_x = F_{1x} + F_{2x} = 15 + 14.34 \\approx 29.34 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nResultant y-component:\n\n\\[\nR_y = F_{1y} + F_{2y} = 0 + 20.48 \\approx 20.48 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 4: Calculate the Magnitude of the Resultant Force\nThe magnitude of the resultant force R can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: \\[\nR = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}\n\\]\nCalculating R : \\[\nR = \\sqrt{(29.34)^2 + (20.48)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{861.64 + 419.04} \\approx \\sqrt{1280.68} \\approx 35.8 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 5: Determine the Direction of the Resultant Force\nThe direction (angle \\(\\theta\\) of the resultant force can be found using the tangent function: \\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{R_y}{R_x}\n\\] \\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{20.48}{29.34}\\right)\n\\]\nCalculating \\(\\theta\\): \\[\n\\theta \\approx \\tan^{-1}(0.698) \\approx 55.2^\\circ\n\\]\nFinal Answer\nMagnitude of the Equilibrium Force: \\(\\approx 35.8 \\, \\text{N}\\)\nDirection of the Equilibrium Force: \\(\\approx 55.2^\\circ\\) above the horizontal (in the direction of the 15 N force).\n\n\nExample 2.4 A 200 kg mass is suspended as shown in Figure 2.1. Rope A is attached to a beam in two places and is passed through a ring that rest naturally at the centre of rope A. Rope B is attached to the bottom of the ring, and to the 200 kg mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: A 200 kg suspended mass.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the tension in rope B?\nDraw a free body diagram of the forces exerted on the ring.\nWhat is the tension in rope A?\n\nGiven Information\n\nMass \\(m = 200 \\, \\text{kg}\\)\nGravitational acceleration \\(g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)\nAngle \\(\\theta = 25^\\circ\\)\n\n\nTension in Rope B\n\nThe tension \\(T_B\\) in Rope B must support the entire weight of the mass. Therefore,\n\\[\nT_B = m \\cdot g = 200 \\times 9.81 = 1962 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nSo, the tension in Rope B is 1962 N.\n\nFree Body Diagram of the Ring\n\nThe ring is in equilibrium, meaning the net force acting on it is zero. Here’s a breakdown of the forces:\n\nTension \\(T_B\\): Acts downward, equal to the weight of the 200 kg mass.\nTensions \\(T_{A1}\\) and \\(T_{A2}\\): These are the tensions in each side of Rope A. Since the ring is at the center and the setup is symmetrical, \\(T_{A1} = T_{A2} = T_A\\).\n\nSince the ring is in equilibrium, the vertical components of \\(T_{A1}\\) and \\(T_{A2}\\) must balance the downward force from \\(T_B\\).\n\nTension in Rope A\n\nSince the angle between each side of Rope A and the horizontal is \\(\\theta = 25^\\circ\\), we can use trigonometry to find \\(T_A\\).\nThe equilibrium condition is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot T_A \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) = T_B\n\\]\nSolving for \\(T_A\\):\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{T_B}{2 \\sin(\\theta)}\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{1962}{2 \\cdot \\sin(25^\\circ)}\n\\]\nCalculating:\n\\[\nT_A \\approx 2321.24 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nSo, the tension in Rope A is approximately 2321.24 N.",

Established to provide a consistent framework for scientific and technical measurements, SI units facilitate clear communication and data comparison across various fields and countries. The system is based on seven fundamental units: the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for substance, and the candela for luminous intensity.\nChapter 2: In mathematics and physics, a scalar is a quantity with only magnitude (size), whereas a vector has both magnitude and direction. Examples of scalar quantities include numbers, mass, speed, temperature, volume, and time. In contrast, examples of vector quantities include velocity, acceleration, and forces like weight and friction.\n\n\n\n\nAhrens, Sönke. 2022.
