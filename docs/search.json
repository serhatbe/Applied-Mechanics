This method relies on multiplying by fractions that are equal to one, where the numerator and the denominator represent the same quantity in different units. Since any number multiplied by one remains the same, unity fractions allow for seamless conversion without changing the value.\nThe principle of unity fractions is based on:\n\nSetting up equal values: Write a fraction where the numerator and denominator are equivalent values in different units, so the fraction equals one. For example, \\(\\frac{1km}{1000m}\\) is a unity fraction because 1 km equals 1000 m.\nMultiplying by unity fractions: Multiply the initial quantity by the unity fraction(s) so that the undesired units cancel out, leaving only the desired units.",

    "text": "2.2 Concepts\nIn mathematics and physics, a scalar is a quantity with only magnitude (size), whereas a vector has both magnitude and direction. Examples of scalar quantities include numbers, mass, speed, temperature, volume, and time. In contrast, examples of vector quantities include velocity, acceleration, and forces like weight and friction.\nA vector is represented as an arrow, where the length denotes its magnitude, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Vector diagrams are useful for visually conveying information about vector relationships, allowing us to analyze effects like the combination of forces or the movement of objects in two or three dimensions. In such diagrams, vectors are often drawn to scale and placed with respect to an origin or another reference point.\n\n2.2.1 Coplanar Forces\nCoplanar forces are forces that act within the same plane. This means they lie along a single, flat surface, and their lines of action do not extend out of that plane. Coplanar forces are often analyzed together in physics and engineering because their combined effects can be resolved within two dimensions.\n\n\n2.2.2 Addition of Vectors by Nose-to-tail Method\nThe “nose-to-tail” method, also known as the “head-to-tail”, is a visual way to add vectors in physics or engineering. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\nDraw the First Vector: Start by drawing the first vector on your graph or paper. This vector should have its tail (starting point) at the origin or any chosen starting point. Make sure you draw it with the correct direction and length to scale.\nPlace the Second Vector: Take the second vector and place its tail at the “head” (or “tip”) of the first vector. The direction and length should be accurately represented here as well.\nContinue with Additional Vectors: If there are more vectors to add, repeat the process by placing each vector’s tail at the head of the previous one.\nDraw the Resultant Vector: The resultant vector, or the sum of all the vectors, is the vector that goes directly from the “tail” of the first vector to the “head” of the last vector in the chain. Draw this vector as a straight line connecting the starting point to the endpoint of the last vector.\nMeasure the Resultant: The length and direction of this resultant vector represent the combined effect of all the original vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Addition of Vectors by Nose-to-tail Method\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Addition of Vectors by Parallelogram Method\nThe parallelogram method is another visual technique for adding two vectors, specifically used when you have two vectors that start from the same point. Here’s how it works:\n\nDraw Both Vectors: Start by drawing the two vectors with their tails (starting points) at the same origin point. The direction and length of each vector should be accurate and to scale.\nComplete the Parallelogram: Using the two vectors as adjacent sides, imagine a parallelogram where each vector is duplicated to form the opposite sides. Draw lines parallel to each vector from the head (tip) of the other vector to form a closed parallelogram.\nDraw the Resultant Vector: The resultant vector, or the sum of the two vectors, is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram that starts from the common origin point of the two vectors and goes to the opposite corner of the parallelogram.\nMeasure the Resultant: The length and direction of this diagonal vector represent the combined effect of the two vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Addition of Vectors by Parallelogram Method\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Space Diagrams\nThe space diagram is an illustration of the system of forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Space Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Vector Diagrams\nThe vector diagram is a diagram drawn to scale with the vectors joined end to end. Vector diagrams are used to analyze and combine forces to find the resultant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Vector Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Resultant\nThe resultant is a single force that represents the combined effect of two or more forces acting on an object. It has the same effect as applying all the original forces together and is found by adding the individual forces, taking both their magnitudes and directions into account. The resultant gives the overall direction and magnitude of the combined forces as shown in Figure 2.4.\n\n\n2.2.7 Equilibrium\nEquilibrium of an object occurs when all the forces acting on it are balanced, so the object remains at rest or moves at a constant speed in a straight line. In equilibrium, there is no net force or acceleration, meaning the object is in a stable state without any change in its motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Equilibrant\n\n\n\nConditions of equilibrium:\n\nNet force must be zero:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k} \\vec{F}_{k} = \\vec{0}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\n\nNet torque must be zero:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k} \\vec{\\tau}_{k} = \\vec{0}\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\n\n\n2.2.8 Bow’s Notation\nBow’s Notation is a graphical method employed in structural engineering to label the forces acting on a truss or structural framework. The notation was developed by British mathematician Robert Bow in the 19th century and continues to be a practical tool for visualizing and solving force equilibrium problems in structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Bow’s Notation Space Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Bow’s Notation Vector Diagram\n\n\n\n\n2.2.8.1 Key Concepts of Bow’s Notation\n\nLabeling Spaces Between Forces:\n\nEach space between external forces (such as loads and reactions) and each internal member of a truss is designated with a unique letter (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).\nThese labels are assigned sequentially around the structure in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction.\n\nForce Polygon:\n\nEach labeled space corresponds to a point on a force polygon, which is a closed polygon representing the equilibrium of forces.\nThe lengths and directions of the sides of the force polygon reflect the magnitudes and directions of the forces in each member.\n\nMember Notation:\n\nEach truss member is identified by the two letters representing the spaces it separates. For instance, a member between spaces A and B is labeled as AB.\n\nUtilizing Bow’s Notation in Analysis:\n\nAfter labeling the spaces, equilibrium equations and graphical methods (such as constructing a force polygon) can be employed to determine the magnitude and direction of each force in the truss.\nThe notation simplifies calculations by visually connecting the forces and facilitating the identification of how different forces interact within the structure.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.8.2 Example of Bow’s Notation Application\nIn a simple triangular truss, the spaces surrounding the triangle may be labeled A, B, and C. If the members connect these spaces, they would be named as AB, BC, and CA. By employing Bow’s Notation, engineers can construct a force polygon, analyze it for equilibrium, and determine the unknown forces in each member of the truss.\n\n\n\n2.2.9 Slings\nA sling is a device or assembly of ropes, cables, or straps used to support and lift loads. Slings play a crucial role in rigging operations, allowing objects to be lifted, lowered, or moved safely and efficiently. Slings are arranged to distribute the load evenly across their length, reducing stress points and ensuring stability. In multi-leg slings (e.g., two-leg or four-leg), the load is shared among the sling legs, which helps stabilize and balance the load.\n\n\n2.2.10 Jib Cranes\nA simple jib crane has a vertical post, a jib, and a tie. The jib is hinged at its lower end to the post, and the tie connects the top of the jib to the base of the post, forming the crane head where the tie and jib meet.\nWhen a load is hung directly from the crane head, solving for forces involves a simple triangle of forces. In other cases, the crane may have a pulley at the head, with a rope running over it to a winch, creating a system with more than three forces.",

Therefore, its magnitude is:\n\\[\nF_3 = F_r \\approx 32.02\\:\\text{N}\n\\]\nThe direction of the third force will be opposite to the direction of the resultant force, which means it will be directed at an angle of:\n\\[\n\\theta + 180^\\circ \\approx 38.66^\\circ + 180^\\circ \\approx 218.66^\\circ\n\\]\nFinal Answer\nThe magnitude of the third force is approximately \\(32.02  \\text{N}\\) , and its direction is approximately \\(218.66^\\circ\\) (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis or horizontal right).\n\n\nExample 2.3 Determine the magnitude and direction of the equilibrium force resulting from the combination of two forces: a horizontal pull of 15 N and a pull of 25 N at an angle of 55 degrees with respect to the 15 N force.\nTo find the magnitude and direction of the equilibrium force resulting from the combination of two forces (15 N horizontally and 25 N at an angle of 55 degrees), we can use vector addition.\nStep 1: Resolve the Forces into Components\n\nForce \\(F_1 = 15\\:\\text{N}\\) (Horizontal):\n\n\\(F_{1x} = 15\\:\\text{N}\\)\n\\(F_{1y} = 0\\:\\text{N}\\)\n\nForce \\(F_2 = 25\\:\\text{N}\\) at \\(55^\\circ\\):\n\n\\(F_{2x} = F_2 \\cdot \\cos(55^\\circ) = 25 \\cdot \\cos(55^\\circ)\\)\n\\(F_{2y} = F_2 \\cdot \\sin(55^\\circ) = 25 \\cdot \\sin(55^\\circ)\\)\nStep 2: Calculate Components of \\(F_2\\)\nUsing \\(\\cos(55^\\circ) \\approx 0.5736\\) and \\(\\sin(55^\\circ) \\approx 0.8192\\):\n\\[\nF_{2x} = 25 \\cdot 0.5736 \\approx 14.34\\:\\text{N}\n\\]\n\\[\nF_{2y} = 25 \\cdot 0.8192 \\approx 20.48\\:\\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 3: Find the Resultant Components\nNow, we sum the components in the x and y directions:\n\nResultant x-component:\n\n\\[\nR_x = F_{1x} + F_{2x} = 15 + 14.34 \\approx 29.34 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nResultant y-component:\n\n\\[\nR_y = F_{1y} + F_{2y} = 0 + 20.48 \\approx 20.48 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 4: Calculate the Magnitude of the Resultant Force\nThe magnitude of the resultant force R can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: \\[\nR = \\sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}\n\\]\nCalculating R : \\[\nR = \\sqrt{(29.34)^2 + (20.48)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{861.64 + 419.04} \\approx \\sqrt{1280.68} \\approx 35.8 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nStep 5: Determine the Direction of the Resultant Force\nThe direction (angle \\(\\theta\\) of the resultant force can be found using the tangent function: \\[\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{R_y}{R_x}\n\\] \\[\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{20.48}{29.34}\\right)\n\\]\nCalculating \\(\\theta\\): \\[\n\\theta \\approx \\arctan(0.698) \\approx 34.9159^\\circ\n\\]\nFinal Answer\nMagnitude of the Equilibrium Force \\(\\approx 35.8 \\, \\text{N}\\)\nDirection of the Equilibrium Force \\(\\approx 34.92^\\circ\\) above the horizontal (in the direction of the 15 N force).\n\n\nExample 2.4 A ship is heading in a direction N 30° E at a speed which in still water would be 20 knots. It is carried off course by a current of 5 knots in a direction of E 60° S. Calculate the ship’s actual speed and direction.\nSolution:\nWe need to resolve both the ship’s velocity in still water and the current into their vector components (x and y) and then compute the resultant speed and direction.\n\nShip’s velocity in still water (N 30° E at 20 knots):\n\n\nDirection: N 30° E means 30° clockwise from North.\nSpeed: 20 knots.\n\nThe x (East-West) component is: \\[\nv_{x1} = 20 \\times \\cos(30^\\circ) = 20 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 17.32 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\nThe y (North-South) component is: \\[\nv_{y1} = 20 \\times \\sin(30^\\circ) = 20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\n\nCurrent’s velocity (E 60° S at 5 knots):\n\n\nDirection: E 60° S means 60° South of East.\nSpeed: 5 knots.\n\nThe x (East-West) component is: \\[\nv_{x2} = 5 \\times \\cos(60^\\circ) = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\nThe y (North-South) component is: \\[\nv_{y2} = 5 \\times \\sin(60^\\circ) = 5 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 4.33 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\nSince the current is pushing the ship southward, the y-component will be negative: \\[\nv_{y2} = -4.33 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\n\nAdd the components:\n\nTotal x component: \\[\nv_x = v_{x1} + v_{x2} = 17.32 + 2.5 = 19.82 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\nTotal y component: \\[\nv_y = v_{y1} + v_{y2} = 10 - 4.33 = 5.67 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\n\nCalculate the actual speed and direction:\n\n\nThe actual speed is the magnitude of the total velocity vector: \\[\n\\text{Speed} = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = \\sqrt{19.82^2 + 5.67^2} = \\sqrt{393.39 + 32.14} = \\sqrt{425.53} \\approx 20.62 \\, \\text{knots}\n\\]\nThe actual direction is the angle relative to East (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis): \\[\n\\theta = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{v_y}{v_x}\\right) = \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{5.67}{19.82}\\right) \\approx \\tan^{-1}(0.286) \\approx 16.0^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo, the ship’s actual direction is 16.0° North of East.\nFinal Answer, see Figure 2.8:\n\nSpeed: 20.62 knots\nDirection: N 16.0° E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Ship vs Current diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.5 Given the space diagram in Figure 2.9, estimate the resultant vector using a graphical method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Vector Cartesian coordinates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Solution\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.6 Given the space diagram in Figure 2.11, estimate the resultant vector using a graphical method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Vector polar coordinates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Solution\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.7 Three forces of 5 N, 8 N and 13 N act as shown in Figure 2.13.

Determine the speed and actual direction of the ship. Solution shown in Figure 2.20,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.20: Solution\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2.12 A 200 kg mass is suspended as shown in Figure 2.21. Rope A is attached to a beam in two places and is passed through a ring that rest naturally at the centre of rope A. Rope B is attached to the bottom of the ring, and to the 200 kg mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.21: A 200 kg suspended mass.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the tension in rope B?\nDraw a free body diagram of the forces exerted on the ring.\nWhat is the tension in rope A?\n\nGiven Information\n\nMass \\(m = 200 \\, \\text{kg}\\)\nGravitational acceleration \\(g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\)\nAngle \\(\\theta = 25^\\circ\\)\n\n\nTension in Rope B\n\nThe tension \\(T_B\\) in Rope B must support the entire weight of the mass. Therefore,\n\\[\nT_B = m \\cdot g = 200 \\times 9.81 = 1962 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nSo, the tension in Rope B is 1962 N.\n\nFree Body Diagram of the Ring\n\nThe ring is in equilibrium, meaning the net force acting on it is zero. Here’s a breakdown of the forces:\n\nTension \\(T_B\\): Acts downward, equal to the weight of the 200 kg mass.\nTensions \\(T_{A1}\\) and \\(T_{A2}\\): These are the tensions in each side of Rope A. Since the ring is at the center and the setup is symmetrical, \\(T_{A1} = T_{A2} = T_A\\).\n\nSince the ring is in equilibrium, the vertical components of \\(T_{A1}\\) and \\(T_{A2}\\) must balance the downward force from \\(T_B\\).\n\nTension in Rope A\n\nSince the angle between each side of Rope A and the horizontal is \\(\\theta = 25^\\circ\\), we can use trigonometry to find \\(T_A\\).\nThe equilibrium condition is:\n\\[\n2 \\cdot T_A \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) = T_B\n\\]\nSolving for \\(T_A\\):\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{T_B}{2 \\sin(\\theta)}\n\\]\nSubstitute the values:\n\\[\nT_A = \\frac{1962}{2 \\cdot \\sin(25^\\circ)}\n\\]\nCalculating:\n\\[\nT_A \\approx 2321.24 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\nSo, the tension in Rope A is approximately 2321.24 N.",
