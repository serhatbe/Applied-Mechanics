## Stress ($\sigma$)

Stress is defined as the internal force per unit area within a material that arises due to externally applied forces. It is given by:

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
$$

Where:

-   $\sigma$ is the stress (Pa),

-   $F$ is the applied force (N),

-   $A$ is the cross-sectional area (m$^2$).

In the case of direct tensile or compressive forces, the area carrying the force is the cross-section in the plane of the material normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the direction of the force.

$$ 
\tau = \frac{F}{A} 
$$

Where:

-   $\tau$ is the shearing stress (Pa),

-   $F$ is the shearing force (N),

-   $A$ is the cross-sectional area (m$^2$).

## Strain ($\varepsilon$)

Strain is a measure of deformation representing the relative change in the material's dimensions under stress. It is dimensionless since it is a ratio. Strain is defined as:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
$$

Where:

-   $\varepsilon$ is the strain (unitless),

-   $\Delta L$ is the change in length,

-   $L_0$ is the original length.

## Hooke's Law

For linear elastic materials, stress is proportional to strain:

For elastic materials:

$$
\sigma = E \varepsilon
$$

$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}
$$

Where:

-   $\sigma$ is the stress (Pa).
-   $\varepsilon$ is the strain (unitless).
-   E: Young’s modulus (Pa), a material property (modulus of elasticity).

## Factor of Safety (FOS)

The **Factor of Safety (FOS)** is a critical concept in engineering design and analysis. It provides a measure of the margin of safety in a structure or material under load. The FOS is defined as the ratio of the material's ultimate strength (breaking stress) to the actual applied stress (working stress).

$$
\text{FOS} = \frac{\text{Breaking Stress}}{\text{Working Stress}}
$$

-   **Breaking Stress**: This refers to the maximum stress that a material can withstand before failure. For tensile stresses, this is called the tensile strength; for compressive stresses, it is the compressive strength.

-   **Working Stress**: The stress experienced by the material under the given loading conditions.

### Importance of FOS

1.  **Safety**: A higher FOS ensures that the structure or material has a greater margin before failure, accounting for uncertainties in loading conditions, material properties, or fabrication methods.
2.  **Economic Design**: While a higher FOS improves safety, it may lead to over-design and increased material costs. Engineers balance safety and cost efficiency to determine an appropriate FOS for each application.

## Tensile Test

The **tensile test** is a mechanical test used to determine the mechanical properties of a material under axial tensile loading. The test involves pulling a specimen apart until it fractures while measuring the applied force and the resulting elongation.

### Procedure

1.  Prepare a standardized specimen with a known cross-sectional area, $A_0$, and gauge length, $L_0$.
2.  Mount the specimen in the testing machine and apply an axial tensile force, $F$.
3.  Record the force and elongation throughout the test until the specimen fractures.

### Key Parameters

-   **Stress (**$\sigma$): Defined as the applied force per unit area: $$
    \sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}
    $$ where:
    -   $F$ is the applied force.
    -   $A_0$ is the initial cross-sectional area.
-   **Strain (**$\epsilon$): Defined as the relative elongation of the specimen: $$
    \epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
    $$ where:
    -   $\Delta L$ is the change in length.
    -   $L_0$ is the initial gauge length.

### Stress-Strain Curve

The stress-strain curve @fig-curve illustrates the material's response to the applied force. Important points on the curve include:

1.  **Elastic Region**: The material deforms elastically and returns to its original shape when the load is removed. Hooke's Law applies: $$
    \sigma = E \epsilon
    $$ where $E$ is the Young's modulus.

2.  **Yield Point**: The stress at which the material begins to deform plastically.

3.  **Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)**: The maximum stress the material can withstand.

4.  **Fracture Point**: The point at which the material fails.

## Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)

**Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)** is the maximum stress a material can endure before breaking. It is determined during a tensile test.

### Formula:

$$ 
\text{UTS} = \frac{F_{\text{max}}}{A_0}
$$

Where:

-   $F_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum applied force (N),

-   $A_0$ is the original cross-sectional area (m$^2$).

### Key Points:

-   **Units**: Measured in Pascals (Pa), commonly in MPa or GPa.
-   **Ductile Materials**: Undergo significant plastic deformation after UTS.
-   **Brittle Materials**: Break shortly after reaching UTS.

Below is a typical stress-strain curve showing the UTS point:
