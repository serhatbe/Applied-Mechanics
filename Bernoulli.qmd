Water flows through a smooth, horizontal venturi meter with an entrance diameter of 375 mm and a throat diameter of 125 mm. If the pressure difference between these sections corresponds to a head of 457 mm of water, determine the mass flow rate in kg/s.

To calculate the **mass flow rate** through the venturi meter, we will use **Bernoulli's principle** and the **continuity equation**.

### Given Data:

**Diameter at entrance (Section 1):**

$$
D_1 = 375\ \text{mm} = 0.375\ \text{m}
$$

**Diameter at throat (Section 2):**

$$
D_2 = 125\ \text{mm} = 0.125\ \text{m}
$$

**Pressure head difference:** $$
h = 457\ \text{mm of water} = 0.457\ \text{m}
$$

**Density of water:** $$
\rho = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3 (for\ water)
$$

### Step 1: Cross-sectional Areas

The areas of the entrance and throat are given by:

$$
A_1 = \frac{\pi D_1^2}{4}, \quad A_2 = \frac{\pi D_2^2}{4}
$$ Substitute the values of $D_1$ and $D_2$:

$$
A_1 = \frac{\pi (0.375)^2}{4} = 0.1104\ \text{m}^2, \quad A_2 = \frac{\pi (0.125)^2}{4} = 0.01227 , \text{m}^2
$$

### Step 2: Bernoulli's Equation Between Two Points

The Bernoulli equation, assuming negligible height differences and no losses, is:

$$
P_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_1^2 = P_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v_2^2
$$

Rearranging for the velocity difference (using the pressure difference in terms of head): $$
\frac{1}{2} \rho (v_2^2 - v_1^2) = \rho g h
$$

Simplify (cancel $\rho$):

$$
\frac{1}{2} (v_2^2 - v_1^2) = g h
$$

Thus: $$
v_2^2 - v_1^2 = 2 g h
$$

### Step 3: Continuity Equation

From the continuity equation:

$$
A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2
$$

Solve for $v_1$ in terms of $v_2$:

$$
v_1 = \frac{A_2}{A_1} v_2 
$$

### Step 4: Substitute $v_1$ into Bernoulli's Equation

Substitute $v_1 = \frac{A_2}{A_1} v_2$ into $v_2^2 - v_1^2 = 2 g h$:

$$
v_2^2 - \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} v_2 \right)^2 = 2 g h
$$

Factor out $v_2^2$:

$$
v_2^2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right)^2 \right) = 2 g h 
$$

Solve for $v_2^2$:

$$
v_2^2 = \frac{2 g h}{1 - \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right)^2}
$$

Take the square root to find $v_2$:

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 g h}{1 - \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right)^2}}
$$

### Step 5: Calculate $v_2$

First, calculate the ratio $\frac{A_2}{A_1}$:

$$
\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{0.01227}{0.1104} = 0.1112
$$

Now calculate $1 - \left( \frac{A_2}{A_1} \right)^2$:

$$
1 - (0.1112)^2 = 1 - 0.01236 = 0.98764
$$

Substitute into the equation for $v_2$ using ($g = 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ and $h = 0.457\ \text{m}$):

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 9.81 \cdot 0.457}{0.98764}}
$$ $$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{8.963}{0.98764}} = \sqrt{9.075} \approx 3.01 , \text{m/s}
$$

### Step 6: Calculate Mass Flow Rate

The mass flow rate is given by:

$$
\dot{m} = \rho A_2 v_2
$$

Substitute $\rho = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$, $A_2 = 0.01227\ \text{m}^2$, and $v_2 = 3.01\ \text{m/s}$:

$$
\dot{m} = 1000 \cdot 0.01227 \cdot 3.01
$$

$$
\dot{m} = 36.95\ \text{kg/s}
$$

### Final Answer:

The mass flow rate is approximately:

$$
\boxed{37.0 \, \text{kg/s}}
$$
