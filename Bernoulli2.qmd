Water flows through a smooth, horizontal Venturi meter with an entrance diameter of 365 mm and a throat diameter of 115 mm. If the pressure difference between these sections corresponds to a head of 467 mm of water, determine the mass flow rate in kg/s.

## **Given Data**

-   **Entrance diameter**, $D_1 = 365\ \text{mm} = 0.365\ \text{m}$
-   **Throat diameter**, $D_2 = 115\ \text{mm} = 0.115\ \text{m}$
-   **Pressure head difference**, $h = 467\ \text{mm} = 0.467\ \text{m}$
-   **Density of water**, $\rho = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$
-   **Gravitational acceleration**, $g = 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$

## **Step 1: Cross-Sectional Areas**

The cross-sectional areas at the entrance $A_1$ and throat $A_2$ are given by:

$$
A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}
$$

1.  For the entrance area $A_1$:

$$
A_1 = \frac{\pi (0.365)^2}{4} = 0.1047 \, \text{m}^2
$$

2.  For the throat area $A_2$:

$$
A_2 = \frac{\pi (0.115)^2}{4} = 0.0104 \, \text{m}^2
$$

## **Step 2: Continuity Equation**

From the continuity equation, the relationship between velocities $V_1$ and $V_2$ is:

$$
A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2 \implies V_1 = \frac{A_2}{A_1} V_2
$$

Substitute the values of ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ):

$$
V_1 = \frac{0.0104}{0.1047} V_2 = 0.0993 V_2
$$

## **Step 3: Bernoulli's Equation**

Bernoulliâ€™s equation relates the head difference $h$ to the velocities $V_1$ and $V_2$:

$$
h = \frac{V_2^2 - V_1^2}{2g}
$$

Substitute $V_1 = 0.0993 V_2$ into the equation:

$$
h = \frac{V_2^2 - (0.0993 V_2)^2}{2g}
$$

Simplify:

$$
h = \frac{V_2^2 - (0.00986 V_2^2)}{2g}
$$

$$
h = \frac{V_2^2 (1 - 0.00986)}{2g}
$$

$$
h = \frac{0.9901 V_2^2}{2g}
$$

Rearranging for $V_2$:

$$
V_2^2 = \frac{2gh}{0.9901}
$$

$$
V_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2gh}{0.9901}}
$$

Substitute $g = 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ and $h = 0.467\ \text{m}$:

$$
V_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 (9.81)(0.467)}{0.9901}}
$$

$$
V_2 = \sqrt{\frac{9.164}{0.9901}} = \sqrt{9.256}
$$

$$
V_2 = 3.043 \, \text{m/s}
$$

## **Step 4: Mass Flow Rate**

The mass flow rate $\dot{m}$ is given by:

$$
\dot{m} = \rho A_2 V_2
$$

Substitute $\rho = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$, $A_2 = 0.0104\ \text{m}^2$, and $V_2 = 3.043\ \text{m/s}$:

$$
\dot{m} = 1000 \times 0.0104 \times 3.043
$$

$$
\dot{m} = 31.65 \, \text{kg/s}
$$

## **Final Answer**

The mass flow rate is:

$$
\boxed{31.65 \, \text{kg/s}}
$$
